### Welcome to my GitHub Profile!

## About me
Hello there! My name is VinÃ­cius Campos Goulart, I studied IT at ETEC Maria Cristina Medeiros and learned there so many things. Currently I am 17 and I am always looking for new knowledge. Even though I am focused on coding, I am aiming on learning things about Cybersecurity, which is the area I want to act on in 5 years.

##Programming Languages
So far, I have learnt how to code in both PHP and Java. I am also trying to learn other coding languages and technologies, per example Javascript and NodeJS.
